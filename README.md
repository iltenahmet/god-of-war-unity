# God of War: Axe Throw and Recall Mechanics

### Overview
This is a Unity project where I have recreated the axe throw and recall mechanics of [God of War](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593500/God_of_War/) which were a staple of the protagonist Kratos' moveset.

Check out [this](https://youtu.be/MI8VVgAylco) video demonstration where I explain some of the functionality of the game in detail.

### Mechanics
- Axe Throw: The player can control the trajectory of the axe by adjusting the angle and power of the throw. The axe will stick to the target upon impact.
- Axe Recall: The axe recall mechanic allows the player to call back the axe to their hand after it has been thrown. The axe returns following a [quadratic bezier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve). The player can recall the axe at any time, even if it is still in motion. 
If the axe hits an enemy on the way back, it will deal damage.
- Attack: The player can perform a simple melee attack with the right mouse button.
